    	<p class="getToKnowUs text-left">Fifteen years working in the real estate industry has made me a tenacious and perseverant broker. A committed advocate for you in making sure you get what you want in finding the perfect home, making a thoughtful investment or housing your family or co-workers. I am dedicated to my clients and work tirelessly to find that right listing. It can often be a lengthy process and I have patience!

    	<p class="getToKnowUs text-left">NYC will always be my home. Whatever you want can be found in the boroughs. Sometimes it just takes a good search!

    	<p class="getToKnowUs text-left">I am currently studying Haitian Creole and Arabic. I am deeply interested in Haiti which I have visited many times. My long term goal is to start a non-profit organization involved with Haiti and eventually open a small hotel in an area which resembles paradise, called the Grande Anse.</br>
