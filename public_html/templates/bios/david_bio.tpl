    	<p class="getToKnowUs text-left">I have 30 years' sales experience assisting clients in qualifying their needs and thoughtfully presenting them with options which satisfy their requirements.

    	<p class="getToKnowUs text-left">My goal is to provide a high level of customer service in all of my projects. Uncompromising integrity and a complete respect of my clients' needs help me to achieve an excellent rate of client retention. My intent is to make real estate transactions as cost effective and efficient as possible. I provide accurate and up-to-date information, skilled analysis and sound real estate advice. Additionally, I continue to explore new trends in New York real estate, network with my colleagues and stay as tech savvy as possible.
        </p><!--/.getToKnowUs-->
    	<p class="getToKnowUs text-left">I love a challenge and enjoy bringing new ideas to the table for discussion and implementation. I enjoy most, working together with my colleagues promoting collaboration in all facets of the process to complete the transaction efficiently and accurately. A single perception is narrow and limited; team collaboration offers infinite vision!</br>
