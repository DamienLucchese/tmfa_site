    	<p class="getToKnowUs text-left">I am a marketing & sales specialist with Taylor Made FA. I have a business degree from the University of Pittsburgh, where I graduated in 2011; majoring in marketing and minoring in management. Being with Taylor Made FA. has allowed me to utilize my degree and to expand my knowledge and experiences within the marketing and management realms. Part of my responsibilities include managing all of Taylor Made's social media outlets, preparing weekly and monthly availability reports for our associates and partners, assisting in the preparation of weekly constant contacts and creating property profiles, which showcase the sophisticated style of the apartments. I enjoy working with clients to assist them with their real estate needs, whether their request is for a temporary, fully furnished apartment or finding them permanent residency. As a licensed real estate sales agent, since 2014, I can accommodate any and all requests.
