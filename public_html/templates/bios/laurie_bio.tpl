    	<p class="getToKnowUs text-left">With more than 20 years in customer service related positions, working with people and guiding them towards a desired end goal seems to fit well with my personality. I like to talk with people, but more importantly I know when and how to listen.

    	<p class="getToKnowUs text-left">Finding the next perfect home or apartment is very personal and an effort that is both time consuming and often stressful. I know this from my first hand experiences. I've lived in New York City for more than 35 years and throughout those years I have secured several rental apartments for my family and made one personal real estate purchase. Looking for a rental apartment is no less important than finding a home to purchase. Both can be full time jobs that many of us don't have the time to commit to it. And for many first time residents in NYC, the process is daunting. That's where working with a knowledgeable, experienced broker can be most beneficial. I work with each of my clients individually to identify their apartment needs and  find options that would work best for them. I take pride in the level of customer service and professionalism provided by my company and the percent of repeat and referral business that I receive.</br>
