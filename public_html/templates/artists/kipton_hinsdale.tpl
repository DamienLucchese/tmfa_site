    	<p class="getToKnowUs text-left">Kipton Hinsdale is a Brooklyn born artist with a fine arts degree in printmaking and sculpture from SUNY Purchase. Having grown up in the city, spending summers upstate, his artwork reflects an urban lifestyle juxtaposed with organic shapes and colors found in nature. Combining different mediums such as pastel, charcoal, ink, wax, and paint, he creates a variety of multi-layered, mixed media, abstract drawings comprised of textured, jagged lines and soft, gestural strokes. 
<br><br>
His work expresses a deep respect for the old masters of abstraction yet reinvigorates the genre with action, movement and characteristic mark making derived from a more contemporary, urban aesthetic. The drawings speak without words, evoking only feelings and emotion, forcing the viewer to search deep within them and find their own meaning or reason. 
<br><br>
Kiptonâ€™s ability to create an array of emotion on one single canvas is a perfect visualization of the environment in which he grew up--- chaotic yet overwhelmingly beautiful.</br>
