    	<p class="getToKnowUs text-left">Lola Jiblazee is an international artist currently residing in New York City. Growing up in Tbilisi, Georgia during the collapse of the Soviet Union had a significant impact on the development of Lola's character, personality and ultimately her art. Drawing from her experiences with extreme poverty and a tumultuous environment during her formative years, she has been able to transform her struggles and convey a sense of depth and bravery in her pieces. Having been heavily influenced by the strong female role models surrounding her, Lola uses acrylic, oil, aerosol paints, and mixed media materials to echo the empowerment of women. She has extensive experience in art direction and leading large teams to the successful completion of various projects. Her honest and unique point of view is evident in a variety of pieces which can be seen in various locations around Manhattan, as well as commissioned works for local businesses.</br>
