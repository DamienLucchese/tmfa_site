	<p class="testimonial_text text-left">When my son moved from Grand Cayman to New York to study, we needed an apartment large enough to accommodate him and visiting family members. David took diligent notes regarding our specific needs. He quickly found us a variety of apartments for rent in the best areas. He did not waste our time with apartments that were not in line with our needs. After a couple of days, thanks to David, we found the perfect apartment we were looking for.
        </p><!--/.testimonial_text-->
	<p class="testimonial_text text-left">I found David to be a highly attentive agent. I never felt neglected or unimportant. He is also highly personable with an engaging personality.

    <p class="testimonial_text text-left"></br>When my husband and I were looking to purchase an apartment in New York we were so fortunate to have Laurie from Taylor Made guiding us through every step of the process.
        </p><!--/.testimonial_text-->
    <p class="testimonial_text text-left">Laurie knew every aspect of the real estate market and she quickly perceived our goals and needs even though initially we couldn't articulate them. From the initial process of exploring areas to the end process of filling out contracts and board approval packages, Laurie was invaluable.
        </p><!--/.testimonial_text-->
    <p class="testimonial_text text-left">I totally trusted Laurie and she never steered us wrong. I would not hesitate recommending Laurie to anyone. She was wonderful and made the whole experience fun.
